This is a VERY SIMPLE tally program made for the CASESTEA general election on March 11, 2011.

Basic Functionalities:
	- There is a tally sheet per precinct where the candidates and their respective positions are listed. (tally.php)
	- A candidate is selected by checking the corrresponding checkbox.
	- Clicking the add button increments the votes for each selected candidate.
	- Summary of results can be viewed at [subdirectory/]admin/results.php
	- The results can be cleared by loading [subdirectory/]admin/reset.php

Requirements
	- PHP, Apache, Postgresql, Firefox

Installation
	- Copy the included files and directories into a subdirectory of the document root of the webserver.
	- (The next steps assumes the use of pgAdmin)
	- Create a database and or another database user
	- Create several tables and their columns
		- positions
			- id (integer, primary key) 
			- name (varchar)
			- composition (smallint) (this is the maximum number of candidates that can be voted upon per position)
		- candidates
			- id (integer, primary key)
			- name (varchar)
			- position_id (foreign key to positions.id. any value here should first be present in the id column of positions table)
		- vote_summary
			- candidate_id (integer, foreign key to candidates.id)
			- precinct_[x] (smallint, default initial value must be 0, as many columns as the number of precincts)
	- Manually add the positions and candidates by adding rows to the positions and candidates tables.
	- Populate the vote summary tables accordingly with one row for each candidate id
	- Modify settings.php accordingly (change the database connection parameters or number of precincts)
